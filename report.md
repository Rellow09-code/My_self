I created repositry in my github account, which then creates a link. Then i proceed to link my git with my github account.
I then created the index.html, report.md and student-info.txt with VS Code.
I then write the required information inside these three files.
Then i pushed the files to github using the terminal, after making the initial commit and using the necessary branch.

I then returned to update my files and then commit the second time, furthermore i bundled the files together.
